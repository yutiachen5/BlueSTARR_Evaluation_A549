# BlueSTARR Evaluation - cell line A549
BlueSTARR: predicting effects of regulatory variants.

Internship with Duke IGVF (2024-2025). 


### In silico mutagenesis on cCREs for Dex and DMSO
 - [variant effect prediction](A549/CRE-preds)

### A549 treated by other drugs
 - [extra drugs](A549/extra_GCs)

### motif soft syntax experiment using real signal and simulated signal for motif GR and AP1
 - [GR-AP1 experiment](A549/GR-AP1/)

### data preparation and model evaluation: 
 - [leave-one-chr-out](A549/leave-one-out/) 
 - [random split](A549/full-set/)
